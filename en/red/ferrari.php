            <div><strong>Ferrari Team Principal Mattia Binotto has expressed his surprise that the Scuderia lead both championships thanks to Charles Leclerc’s brace of wins in the first three races – but said the F1-75 won’t see significant upgrades for the Sprint weekend at Imola on April 22-24.</strong><div>
            <p>
            Ferrari’s Australian Grand Prix weekend wasn’t all smooth sailing, with Carlos Sainz spinning out early on at Albert Park. But rivals Red Bull also saw Max Verstappen stop late on with a reliability issue, while Leclerc’s subsequent Australian Grand Prix win means the Scuderia are frontrunners in both championships – Red Bull third in the constructors’ and Sergio Perez their highest-place driver after three races in P4.<br><br>
            “Yes, I’m certainly surprised,” said Binotto. “I think we worked hard and put a lot of priority on 2022. I knew the team was a great team and we improved ourselves compared to the past seasons, and I was hoping to have a competitive car by the start of the season.<br><br>
            “Then, coming to winter testing, we knew we had a competitive car but certainly I was not expecting such a good car to start the season; it would be unfair to think that. But I still believe the difference between us and our competitors can be very little, as we’ve seen over the past weeks, and we should have great fights in the next races.”<br><br>
            While they lead the championships at this early stage, Ferrari will not be resting on their laurels as their rivals prepare to engage in a competitive development war to upgrade their cars and bridge the gap to the Italian team. However, Binotto batted away speculation that the F1-75 would be upgraded for the upcoming Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, the first of three weekends in 2022 to feature the F1 Sprint format.<br><br>
            “It will be a difficult weekend in terms of bringing upgrades and running them in the Friday practice because you need to focus your set-up on the quali in the afternoon,” he reasoned.<br><br>
            “If we look at ourselves, there will not be [many upgrades] in Imola because it will not be the right place. We’ve tried to mitigate, shall I say, the issue we’ve got still so far – the porpoising and the bouncing – that has affected our performance over the weekend, so we try to work on that specific point.<br><br>
            “But with the upgrades, the more significant ones will be later on in the season.”<br><br>
