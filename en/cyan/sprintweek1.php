            <div><strong>The Sprint F1 format returns for the second year in 2022 - but there are some changes, including a new point system and a few new track locations. Here's what to expect, from Friday's qualify to the main event - the Grand Prix - on Sunday afternoon ...</strong><div>
                <div><strong class="titlu">Where will we see F1 Sprint this year?</strong></div>
            <p>
                Following a review of last year's three Sprint events, the FIA ​​said it had decided to keep the same number for 2022, given pressure on teams to make drastic changes to the aerodynamic rules.<br><br>
                However, there has been a change of circuits that will host the Sprint, and Imola and Red Bull Ring have a chance to run the format.<br><br>
            </p>
                <div><strong class="titlu">What is the format?</strong></div>
            <p>
                As was the case last year, the F1 Sprint will be a 100 km race, with no mandatory pit stops and drivers who will fully compete for the checkered flag.<br><br>
                However, there will be many more in the game this year, with points awarded to the top eight drivers (previously the top three).<br><br>
                The driver who occupies the 1st place will now receive eight points, 5 more than last year's three, with the score decreasing to one point for the eighth place. These points will apply to both drivers 'and constructors' championships.<br><br>
                The order of completion of F1 Sprint will continue to define the schedule for Sunday's event - the Grand Prix, where the traditional format remains unchanged.<br><br>
